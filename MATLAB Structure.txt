MATLAB Simulation Structure

/bin - executables
/etc - system scripts
/lib - /classes, /headers, /config
/src - /sim, /model, /usr

/lib/config:
initialization files
file naming functions
path definitions from driver files

/src/model:
/dyn - dynamics (force models - /gravity, /aero, moments, etc.)
/kin - kinematics (rotation, acceleration, etc.)
/mdl - Simulink/Stateflow, controller, estimator, disturbance, sensor models

/src/sim - inputs to solver (call functions in /dyn and /kin)

/src/usr
driver files
/data
/graphics - /plottingTools, /movie, /gui
/log

Files in /src/sim are functions input to ODE45.
They call functions in /src/model. They should fully define which models are used for plants, controllers, estimators, states, disturbances, etc.
They also determine which ICs are constants.
ICs that are most typically not constant should have the smallest indices to avoid changing most /src/sim functions.

Driver files define:
/src/sim selection
ICs
Real time display options
Overwrite settings
Output data path (/src/usr/data is default)
Load data path for plotting (/src/usr/data is default)
Dispersion settings (disperse ICs and/or disturbances)

Driver files may call functions from any directory.
Driver files may not overwrite /lib, /src, /bin, or /etc files except /src/usr/data


=================================
BUILD IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER
=================================

driver - select eom
driver - select data location
driver - select run cases
driver - plot on/off
eom - ode45 update
overwrite function
plot - after datagen, can be used without running sim
plot - screen output suppression
plot - movie
log - define output logfile location
log - define logfile name (run case, time, date)
log - find >> MATLAB equivalent, file I/O)
Build block diagram with appropriate variables and operations
Euler angles - Simulink block
Create S-Functions
Add gain scheduling controller
Multiple satellites
lambchop/orbit
plot - poincare
