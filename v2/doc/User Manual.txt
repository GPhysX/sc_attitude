SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE SIMULATION

SUMMARY

The goal of this project is to simulate the rotational motion of a spacecraft in orbit. Plots of Euler angles and polhode curves (angular velocity time histories) are generated. Equations of Motion included in this package are for a rigid body in a torque-free environment and in circular orbit. See the EOM section under the Source Code Guide for more information.

The code is designed to be modular. Without getting very fancy, the user only needs to modify sc_attitude, sc_init, and sc_batch, depending on the experiment.

LIMITATIONS

This program does not currently:

Model a spacecraft in noncircular orbit.
Model complex spacecraft. Gyrostats (satellites with stabilizing rotors) are modeled, but nothing more complex is modeled.
Calculate precession and spin angles (in progress).

Future updates are at the end of the manual.

SETUP

MATLAB is required to run this program. All the code is written assuming the necessary functions are in the current path or working directory.

SOURCE CODE GUIDE

Main Script:
sc_attitude - main script, sufficiently commented to get the user started after reading the manual

General:
VERIFY_eom - script used to test sc_symmetricEOMq and sc_gyrostat_EOMC against Kane
sc_init - initializes spacecraft
sc_batch - contains information to pass to sc_init during batch analysis
sc_regionI - calculates s/c region using mass properties without plotting stability chart
sc_regionI - calculates s/c region using mass property ratios without plotting stability chart
save_plot - save figure as .pdf*
section_array - used for combining data for ICs in sc_batch
crossop - generates a cross operator from a vector for Poinsot construction
qrate - rate of change of quaternion elements
The rest in this folder are either unused in the default configuration or have clear titles and short descriptions included in each file.

*requires export_fig (not included, available at MATLAB File Exchange)

Equations of motion:
tf_EOMC
sc_EOMC
tf_EOMq
sc_EOMq
gyrostat_EOMC
symmetric_EOMq

*q ending signifies quaternion orientation representation, while C ending signifies direction cosine matrix (row operator) orientation representation

Forces and Moments (used within EOM functions):
eulerTF - torque free accelerations
f2_C - second-order approximation of gravity moment using C to represent orientation
f2_q - second-order approximation of gravity moment using q to represent orientation
rotor - angular accelerations resulting from using rotors

*User may define more complex forces within functions and add them to existing EOM functions.

Graphics:
plot_sc_euler - plot Euler Angle time histories
plot_sc_polhode - plot polhode curve with inertia ellipsoid
plot_sc_stab - plot mass property ratios on stability chart

SIMPLE MODIFICATIONS

display max angle (edit plot_euler)
export_fig options (edit save_plot)
suppress rotor speed information when not using rotors (edit graph_titles)

FUTURE UPDATES

cleaner spacecraft initialization
-single vs batch run
-automatic selection of IC assignment based on EOM used
euler angle histories
cleaner variable passes especially with plot titles
cleaner figure screen output suppression
cleaner/more modular way to save files
EOM for noncircular orbit and complex spacecraft
EOM for constant torque input
