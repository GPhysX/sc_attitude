sc_attitude
===========

The goal of this project is to simulate the rotational motion of a spacecraft in orbit. Plots of Euler angles and polhode curves (angular velocity time histories) are generated. Equations of Motion included in this package are for a rigid body in a torque-free environment and in circular orbit. See the EOM section under the Source Code Guide for more information.

The code is designed to be modular. Without getting very fancy, the user only needs to modify sc_attitude, sc_init, and sc_batch, depending on the experiment.

Please read the User Manual before using this program.
